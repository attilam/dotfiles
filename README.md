# attilam does dotfiles

attilamのドットファイル。

I don't take responsibility for any harm done by any of these scripts.

## Installation

All files are without leading dot in the file name in the repo. There's an install script, that will create symbolic links to the actual dotfiles in the home directory. 

```bash
./install.sh
```

## Thanks...
